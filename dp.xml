    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Millions, billions, trillions. That many and even more messages are
    exchanged every day between various people over the world. The Internet
    created brand new way to communicate and collaborate, even if you are
    located on the opposite parts of the world. Since the age of Alexander
    Graham Bell, the accesibility to the communication devices and their
    simplicity incredibly enhanced. Nowadays, almost 2.5 billion people over
    the world have access to the Internet and therefore they are able to use
    almost limitless communication possibilities it provides.
    <citation>internet-usage</citation></para>

    <para>However, the manner of Internet usage essentially changed during the
    first decade of 21st century. Using the Internet and using the web browser
    became almost synonyms. People use the web browser as the primary platform
    to do every single task on the Internet. Sometimes it's not even possible
    to use the other internet services without visiting certain web page in
    the web browser and performing the authentication there.<footnote>
        <para>Two examples of such behavior. Wi-fi network in the Student
        Agency coaches forces the user to visit the entry page in the web
        browser. The second example, very well known to the students of the
        Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University, is the faculty wireless
        network called wlan_fi. Every user has to open the web browser and log
        in with her credentials. It's not possible just to open the terminal
        or e-mail client and start working online.</para>
      </footnote> Considering the mentioned fact, web browsers became also the
    basic platform for the communication tools. Even though the purpose of the
    world wide web and HTTP protocol was completely different at first
    (displaying single documents connected via hypertext links), it appeared
    that there is the need of common rich applications running withing web
    browser - rich internet application. So popular social networks are built
    on top of the web browser platform and they are used by more than billion
    people over the world. <citation>facebook-usage</citation> And the main
    reason why the social networks are so popular is the real-time stream of
    news and messages from the other people. By the beginning of the year
    2013, I would say that static web is dead - users prefer
    interactivity.</para>

    <para>This thesis embraces the topic of real-time application in web
    browsers, especially the text communication tools and the technologies
    being used to develop them. It also describes the problem of
    "inter-process" communication between various web pages which need to
    cooperate and exchange information as quickly as possible. Finally, the
    possibilities of multimedia content transfer (audio and video) and the
    current options of capturing multimedia directly from the web browser are
    described as well.</para>

    <para>As mentioned above, the web browser became one of the most popular
    platforms. Celebrio, simple software for the elderly simulating the
    operating system interface, is typical example of rich internet
    application. <citation>celebrio-system</citation> All the topics mentioned
    in the previous paragraph appeared to be very important in the system.
    When questioning the elderly people in the Czech Republic, it appeared
    that almost 90 % of the elderly computer users use the real-time
    communication applications. <citation>elderly-questionnaires</citation>
    Interaction with their loved ones is the most desired benefit they expect
    from the computer. Therefore, creating real-time application, text
    messenger supporting video calling, became not only programming challenge
    but also a business goal.</para>

    <para>In the first chapter, there is .... TODO</para>

    <para>The programming part of the thesis comprises the implementation of
    real-time text chat application, video calling application and simple
    "inter-process" communication tool for Celebrio.</para>

    <title>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol</title>

    <para>At first, this chapter should describe the important parts of XMPP
    protocol (mostly just picking the appropriate references).</para>

    <para>Later on, description of BOSH extension, including the advantages
    and limitations. Describe also the connection to HTTP protocol.</para>

    <para>Jingle extension - multimedia. Does this deserve complete
    chapter???</para>

    <para>Pub-sub extensions for inter-process communication.</para>
