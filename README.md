My master thesis

The repository contains thesis source files (both for DocBook and TeX), 
included images, diagrams and charts. If you want to create PDF on your
own, you need to have TeX, DocBook, XSLT2 and Fithesis installed and
set up. If you don't need to create PDF on your own (and you really don't),
just download it - it is included among the files in repo.

I would be happy to hear any feedback, corrections and comments. Either
by pull requests (however, I will not include them directly to my thesis
since it is supposed to be my original work) or as Gist comments. Feel
free to ping me at my Twitter account: [@pavelsmolka](https://twitter.com/pavelsmolka)

You may use and distribute the thesis files as long as you

Also, this license note must be included for the third party
to do the same. Thank you!
